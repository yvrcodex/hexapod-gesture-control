## Handling Placeholders in Large Projects

In large projects, encountering placeholders is common, especially during the initial development or when certain sections or functionalities have not been fully implemented. To leave notes that other project members can easily understand, it is a good practice to use clear and descriptive comments. Here are some helpful suggestions on how to do it:

- `// TODO:` Use the "TODO" comment followed by a concise description of what needs to be done. For example: `// TODO: Implement the image processing module.` This indicates that this part of the code still needs to be developed.

- `// FIXME:` If you encounter a problem or bug that needs to be fixed, you can use the "FIXME" comment followed by a brief description of the issue. For example: `// FIXME: Fix the memory leak issue here.`

- `// NOTE:` To provide additional information or explanations about a specific part of the code, you can use the "NOTE" comment. For example: `// NOTE: This function assumes that the input data is sorted.`

- `// HACK:` If you had to make a temporary or non-ideal solution to solve a problem, you can use the "HACK" comment to make it clear that this is not the final solution. For example: `// HACK: This code works around a compatibility issue with library X. A better solution is needed.`

- `// IDEA:` If you have an idea to improve or expand a specific feature, use the "IDEA" comment to share it with other developers. For example: `// IDEA: Consider adding support for feature Y to improve performance.`

- `// QUESTION:` If you have a question or concern about a part of the code, use the "QUESTION" comment to indicate that a discussion or clarification is needed. For example: `// QUESTION: Is this approach safe for multi-threading?`

- `// DEPRECATED:` If you are planning to remove a function or feature in future versions, use the "DEPRECATED" comment to inform other developers. For example: `// DEPRECATED: This function will be removed in version 2.0. Use the newFunction() instead.`

Remember that it is essential to keep these comments up to date, and as soon as the placeholders are replaced by complete implementations, you should remove or update them accordingly. This helps ensure that other team members have a clear understanding of the project's status and what tasks still need to be completed.
