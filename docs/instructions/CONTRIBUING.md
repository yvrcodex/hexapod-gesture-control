# Contribution Guide - Hexapod Project

Welcome to the Hexapod Project team! This guide aims to provide important information to help you contribute to the development of the hexapod robot.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a hexapod with 12 servo motors controlled by microcontrollers, capable of autonomous movement, various locomotion modes, and specific tasks execution.

## Important Topics

### **Kinematics and Motion Control**

For the success of the project, it is essential to understand the concepts of forward and inverse kinematics. This involves calculating the positions of the robot's legs based on desired coordinates and vice versa. Additionally, study motion control algorithms to ensure smooth and accurate movements of the hexapod.

### **Microcontrollers and Servo Motors**

Our microcontrollers will be responsible for controlling the 12 servo motors of the hexapod. It is important to study the specifications of the motors and learn how to efficiently use the microcontrollers to control leg movements.

### **Libraries and Frameworks**

To save time and effort, we will research and use existing libraries and frameworks that facilitate the implementation of complex functions, such as inverse kinematics. Additionally, we will consider frameworks like ROS for advanced robotics capabilities.

### **Testing and Iterations**

During the development of the project, we will conduct frequent and iterative testing. We will test kinematics algorithms, motion control codes, and robot functionality in different scenarios to ensure correct operation and performance.

## **Additional Resources**

Here are some additional resources useful for studying and developing the project:
1. **Online Robotics Tutorials:** Look for online tutorials and courses that cover topics related to robotics, kinematics, and control systems. Websites like Coursera, Udemy, and edX offer a wide range of courses in these areas.

2. **Robotic Simulation Software:** Consider using robotic simulation software like Webots, V-REP, or Gazebo. These tools allow you to create virtual simulations of the hexapod, test algorithms, and validate control strategies before deploying them on the physical robot.

3. **Robotics Forums and Communities:** Join robotics-related forums and online communities where you can ask questions, share ideas, and learn from experienced roboticists. Websites like Robotics Stack Exchange and ROS Discourse are excellent places to seek help and engage in discussions.

4. **Research Papers and Journals:** Read academic papers and journals related to hexapod robots, robotic kinematics, and control algorithms. These papers often provide valuable insights and state-of-the-art techniques in the field of robotics.

5. **GitHub Repositories:** Explore other open-source robotics projects on GitHub, especially those that involve hexapods or similar legged robots. Analyzing their code, implementations, and approaches can provide inspiration and valuable learning experiences.

6. **Robotic Kits and Educational Platforms:** Some companies offer robotic kits and educational platforms specifically designed for learning and experimentation. Kits like the "Arduino Hexapod Robot Kit" or "Raspberry Pi Hexapod Kit" can be a great starting point for hands-on learning.

7. **Robotics Conferences and Meetups:** Attend robotics conferences or local meetups if possible. These events are excellent opportunities to network, attend workshops, and learn from experts in the field.

8. **ROS Documentation and Tutorials:** If you decide to use ROS (Robotic Operating System), explore its official documentation and tutorials. ROS has a vast community and extensive documentation, which can be a valuable resource for robotic development.

9. **Online Robotics Challenges:** Participate in online robotics challenges or competitions that focus on legged robots. These challenges often require solving complex problems and can help you refine your robot's capabilities.

Remember that the key to a successful project is a continuous learning process. Stay curious, keep researching, and don't hesitate to experiment with different approaches. Embrace the iterative development process, and as you progress, you will likely discover more resources and techniques that suit your specific project requirements.
